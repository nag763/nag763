I just enjoy doing IT projects on my spare time, whatever the topic is. I try to make them open-source and deliver quality code that can be used by other developers, the way I sometimes inspire myself from existing projects.

I mostly work with Java and Javascript in my professional environment, however I prefer working with Rust in my spare time, hence why my profile mostly contains Rust projects.

Check out my most complete and best documented projects if you have some time :blush: :
