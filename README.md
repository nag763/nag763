I'm a 27-year-old French software engineer currently living in Denmark üá©üá∞. I enjoy creating open-source IT projects in my spare time. I strive to deliver quality code that can be useful to other developers, just as I often draw inspiration from existing projects.

While I primarily work with Java, Python and JavaScript in my professional life, I have a passion for Rust, which is why you'll find many Rust-based projects on my profile.
